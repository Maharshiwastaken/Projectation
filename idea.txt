Internal Project For CSIT 3rd Semester

-> We need to make a story.
-> Basic decision codes.
-> Graphical elements.

Decided to use doors as a main theme for the project, each time we pass throough a door, then the environment changes
and we wont have to keep on applying nested conditions, we can just use switch case statements to switch environments and
move forwardd with the story.

Me -> passes through a door -> generates a random switch case statement number -> game jumps to a random location

Need to make a door in C graphically

Then, the number of doors passed through is calculated by the counter, when the counter reaches max, then we pass an
unskippable end line and end the game.
